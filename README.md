# robotics-ex2

![Alt text]("Title")

This repo is for exercise 2 in the robotics course in ariel university.

## Our code scans frame by frame and return the following:

The QR’s ID (number between 0 and 1023),
The QR’s 2D info - the 4 corner points (in frame coordinates).
The QR’s 3D info: the Distance to the camera, the yaw angle with respect to the camera “lookAt” point.

### we have two outputs:

1. CSV file:
   frameID,id,pos,dist,angle,pitch-roll
2. Vidoe that contains markers and ids for each aruco code.
